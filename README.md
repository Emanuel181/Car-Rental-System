C++ Project - Car Rental System

The purpose of this project is to streamline how the car rental applications work.
The following app has 3 main options:
  1. Administrator option
  2. Manager option
  3. Client option


The administrator part can view the list of companies registered. Addtionally, he can warn the companies if the reviews are worse and he can even remove them (after several warnings) if the clients are constantly submitting negative reviews. <br/><br/>
The manager option is dedicated to the company and its branches (multiple locations in the country). Each location has its manager and list of cars. Clients are able to rent a car from a location and drop it to another location should he wish to. <br/><br/>
The client side includes gathering of personal data (firstname, lastname, driving license details etc. ). Furthermore, the client has the option to select from which location he would like to rent a car and for how long. Following this process, an immediate response will be given regarding the availability of the car and the steps to be followed in the case of non-availability of the car. <br/><br/><br/>


A more in depth description regarding more functionalities for all 3 profiles will be provided soon.
